<p>History of Charminar
      Charminar was built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591. It is said that this square shaped structure with four pillars and intricate carvings was built in honour of his wife, Bhagmati. However, the actual reason behind building Charminar is still not clear.
    
    As per a popular belief, Charminar was built to acknowledge the elimination of the plague which had affected the entire city immensely during that era. It is believed that the Sultan had prayed for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering. Hence, as the plague ended, he built the charminar as a tribute to Allah. The four pillars are also said to be dedicated to the first four caliphs of Islam.
    
    It is also said that it was built in the memory of Prophet Muhammed’s son in law who lost his life at the battle of Karbala as its design is in the shape of Shiya Tazias. Some also believe that the location of Charminar is the place where Sultan had seen his then future wife Bahgmati for the first time.
    
    As per a French traveller, Jean de Thévenot who travelled in the 17th century, the reason for its construction is entirely different. According to his narration which is in sync with the Persian texts as well, Charminar was built to commemorate the start of the second Islamic millennium.</p><br>
    <h3 style="color: blue;">Golkonda Fort</h3><br>
    <p>The origins of the Golconda fort can be traced back to the 11th century. It was originally a small mud fort built by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire.[3] The name Golconda is thought to originate from the Telugu గొల్ల కొండ Golla koṇḍa for "Shepherd's hill".[4][5] It is also thought that Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva 1199–1262 built a stone hilltop outpost — later known as Golconda fort — to defend their western region.[6] The fort was later developed into a fortified citadel in 1518 by Sultan Quli of the Qutb Shahi Empire and the city was declared the capital of the Golconda Sultanate.[5]

        The Bahmani kings took possession of the fort after it was made over to them by means of a sanad by the Rajah of Warangal.[3] Under the Bahmani Sultanate, Golconda slowly rose to prominence. Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (r. 1487–1543), sent by the Bahmanids as a governor at Golconda, established the city as the seat of his governance around 1501.</p><br>
        <h3 style="color: blue;">Ramojiflim city</h3><br>
        <p>Ramoji Film City, located on the outskirts of Hyderabad in Abdullapurmet, was conceived by Ramoji Rao.[5] Designed to mirror the grand studios of Hollywood, it was envisioned as a comprehensive film production and thematic destination.[6] On procuring the land, Ramoji Rao signed art director Nitish Roy to design the complex. The land, initially comprising jungles and mountainous terrain, was preserved during construction, with minimal alteration to the natural environment.[7] The first film shot at the studio was Maa Naannaku Pelli (1997).</p><br>
        <h3 style="color: blue;">Birla Mandir</h3>
        <p>Birla Mandir in Hyderabad is named after the Birla family, who were responsible for its construction. The temple was built by the Birla Foundation, a prominent Indian industrial and philanthropic family. The Birla family has a long history of contributing to the construction of several temples and cultural institutions in India. In many cases, these institutions are named "Birla Mandir" or "Birla Temple" to acknowledge the family's significant contributions to their construction. The name "Birla Mandir" serves as a recognition of the family's philanthropic efforts and their dedication to promoting cultural and religious values in India.

            Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath Pahad on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The construction took ten years and was opened in 1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by the Birla Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples across India, all known as Birla Mandir.</p><br>
